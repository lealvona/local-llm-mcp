"""Command policy: what may actually be executed when a caller delegates a shell command.

The opt-in gate (:mod:`.arming`) covers turning the server ON for a session. After that,
every command the caller chooses runs here with this user's privileges — and a client in a
bypass or auto permission mode never shows the user a per-tool prompt, so the client's own
approval layer cannot be relied on. This module is the server's own line, in three layers:

1. **Deny shapes** — refused outright, nothing run, the reason returned to the caller. Shapes
   only: destructive or privilege-changing verbs, package installs, a pipe from the network
   into a shell, and writes into ``/etc``, ``/boot`` or ``~/.ssh``. A command that would
   rehydrate a **secret** placeholder is refused too — a secret is never handed to a shell.
2. **An allow list** the operator keeps (``LOCAL_LLM_MCP_RUN_ALLOW``, one glob per line): the
   standing approval for the shapes they delegate every day (``git log*``, ``journalctl*``,
   ``ls*``, ``rg*``, ``pytest*``). Every segment of the command must match one.
3. **Everything else asks** — the same MCP elicitation the gate uses, showing the exact
   command: run once / always allow this shape / refuse. "Always" appends to the allow file.
   A client that cannot ask gets layer 1 only and a trailer line saying so.

No allow entry can exempt a deny shape; layer 1 is checked first, always.

Non-goals, deliberately: this is not a sandbox and does not parse shell semantics. It reads
command position, quoting and redirection well enough to judge shapes, and it does not try to
follow a script it invokes, a variable it expands, or an alias. It is a second lock on a door
the user already opened, not a jail.
